# InsightEngine: Rebuild Plan

This document outlines our complete rebuild strategy for the InsightEngine project, focusing on creating a robust, maintainable system that fulfills the original vision with proper software engineering practices.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Domain Model
- [ ] Define proper domain entities with validation
- [ ] Create value objects for core concepts
- [ ] Design aggregate roots and boundaries
- [ ] Implement domain events for key state changes

### Database Architecture
- [ ] Implement SQLAlchemy ORM layer
- [ ] Set up Alembic for database migrations
- [ ] Design proper schema with relationships
- [ ] Create repository interfaces and implementations
- [ ] Implement unit of work pattern for transactions

### Vector Storage
- [ ] Evaluate vector database options (FAISS, Chroma, etc.)
- [ ] Create abstraction layer for vector operations
- [ ] Implement proper indexing and search strategies
- [ ] Add support for hybrid search (keywords + vectors)

## Phase 2: Core Services

### Memory Management
- [ ] Implement chunking service with proper overlap
- [ ] Create token budget management system
- [ ] Design document processor pipeline
- [ ] Build memory quality assessment service
- [ ] Implement forgetting mechanism with time decay

### Context Assembly
- [ ] Design weighted retrieval algorithm
- [ ] Implement adaptive context building
- [ ] Create context visualization system
- [ ] Add metadata filtering capabilities
- [ ] Build theme-based grouping system

### LLM Integration
- [ ] Create provider-agnostic LLM interface
- [ ] Implement robust error handling and retries
- [ ] Add streaming support for all operations
- [ ] Build proper prompt template system
- [ ] Implement JSON mode for structured outputs

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### Self-Reflection System
- [ ] Design evaluation framework for responses

- [ ] Implement insight application mechanism

### Summary Generation
- [ ] Design incremental summary system
- [ ] Implement hierarchical summarization
- [ ] Create topic extraction and classification
- [ ] Build narrative understanding framework
- [ ] Add metadata enrichment for summaries

## Phase 4: Application Layer

### Chat Framework
- [ ] Create modular chat engine
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Build persona and preference system
- [ ] Add multi-turn conversation handling
- [ ] Implement streaming responses

### CLI Tools
- [ ] Design composable command architecture

- [ ] Add visualization for context assembly
- [ ] Build conversation explorer
- [ ] Implement user management

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality

### Testing Framework
- [ ] Set up pytest with fixtures
- [ ] Implement LLM response mocking
- [ ] Create integration test suite
- [ ] Build performance benchmarking
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement static code analysis
- [ ] Add type checking with mypy
- [ ] Create documentation generation
- [ ] Build systematic error reporting

## Getting Started

To implement this plan, we'll focus on establishing the foundation first (Phase 1) before moving on to later phases. Each component will be built with clean interfaces, proper testing, and documentation.
